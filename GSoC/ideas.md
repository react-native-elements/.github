### Google Summer of Code'21 - Proposal Ideas


> This year's GSoC is different. Previously GSoC was 12 weeks with 30 hours/week commitment by students but this year it's 10 weeks with 18 hours/week commitment. So, it's 50% reduced. Please consider the same while writing proposal/s.


#### 1. Design 2.0

> Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Design 2.0

The library contains 20+ elements (components), but there’s some mismatch in the overall design. The idea is to improve or redesign the components for a new look and feel.

_What can be done?_

- Propose a new design for the core components.
- A11y is the priority.
- Code the new component design.

#### 2. Migration to & Hooks

> Difficulty: Hard | Tags: Hooks, Animation, Testing

The project was started way back in 2016 when React Hooks is not a thing. The idea is to migrate the class-based components to hooks and adopt new react patterns.

_What can be done?_

- Migrate to React Hooks.
- Refactor the animations to support useNativeDriver API
- Testing

#### 3. Automatically Generated Docs from Proptypes (Medium)

> Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Docs Autogen

For any change in the API (Prop) of any component, related docs are needed to be updated manually. The idea is to auto-generate the API Docs (Props definition) of the components from the prop definition in the code.

#### 4. Embed Playground in the Document Website (Medium)

> Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Website Merge

Currently, we have 2 websites for documentation.

- [Reactnativeelements.com](https://reactnativeelements.com/) This contains just the documentation of the components, build using docusaurus.
- [React-native-elements.js.org](https://react-native-elements.js.org/#/) An interactive component playground.

The idea is to merge the two into one, i.e. the document website which embeds the Playground.

#### 5. Not Listed above but trust me it’s crazy.

We know you are awesome and you have an innovative idea, feel free to the proposal.
